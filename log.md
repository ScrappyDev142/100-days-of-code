# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:July 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic HTML section from freecoodecamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm somewhat disappointed in myself because I could have gone further. I just lacked focus. I will have to do better tomorrow.

### Day 2: July 11, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I spent most of my time on the JavaScript part of freecoodecamp. I did a little bit of CSS.

**Thoughts**: I really need to drop YouTube. It's killing my progress. I still lack focus. I need to get my act together.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
